streamplot
==========
Matplotlib based real time plotting
    
Installation
============
There isn't any. You may want to move the `streamplot.py` file to somewhere on your `$PATH`, remove the `.py` extension and make it executable. For example:
```
$ cp /path/to/streamplot.py ~/bin/streamplot
$ chmod +x ~/bin/streamplot
```

Documentation
=============
The `streamplot.py` file contains a class and driver for reading and plotting a stream of incoming data from stdin in real time. Any line beginning with with `PLOT_MARKER` (defaults to `'>>'`) is input to be plotted. Everything else will print to stdout.

The stream can contain data for multiple subplots (separated by `ROW_SEP`) and multiple lines per plot (separated by spaces `COL_SEP`). `ROW_SEP` and `COL_SEP` default to `';'` and `' '` respectively. The first line beginning with `PLOT_MARKER` defines the number of plots and number of lines per plot and all other lines are assumed to follow the same format.

Sometimes an example is worth a thousand words. If we wanted to have 3 separate plots having 3, 2, and 4 lines respectively, the input stream should look something like:
```
>> 1 2 3; 4 5; 6 7 8 9;
>> 0.5 1.5 2.5; 3.5 4.5; 5.5 6.5 7.5 8.5;
some status message
>> 0 1 2; 3 4; 5 6 7 8; 
another status message
```

Usage
=====
streamplot is designed for use within a command line environment. All the following examples assume you've moved streamplot somewhere on your `$PATH`, removed the `.py` extension, and made it executable as described in the Installation section above. The simplest use case is
```
$ somedatageneratingprocess | python streamplot.py
```
Buffering issues with pipes can cause the plot to not show until the the first process finishes. The simplest way to deal with this is use the [expect](http://expect.sourceforge.net/) [unbuffer](http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/unbuffer1.html) command.
```
$ unbuffer somedatageneratingprocess | streamplot
```
streamplot also can also save the final image to a file by passing an output file name with an extension supported by your matplotlib install.
```
$ somedatageneratingprocess | streamplot img.png
```
For a list of available extensions in a python prompt type
```python
>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
>> print plt.gcf().canvas.get_supported_filetypes()
```
To specify an alternate `PLOT_MARKER` use `-p`
```
$ somedatageneratingprocess | streamplot -p 'error ='
```
To specify alternate `ROW_SEP` or `COL_SEP` use `-R` or `-C`
```
$ somedatageneratingprocess | streamplot -R $'\t' -C ','
```
To add labels use `-l`
```
$ somedatageneratingprocess | streamplot -l 'a1 a2 a3; b1 b2; c1'
```
To add specify colors use `-c`
```
$ somedatageneratingprocess | streamplot -l 'r r r; b b; g'
```
For full usage information type
```
$ streamplot -h
usage: streamplot.py [-h] [-p PLOT_MARKER] [-R ROW_SEP] [-C COL_SEP]
                     [-l LABELS] [-c COLORS]
                     [output]

positional arguments:
  output                output file name

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p PLOT_MARKER, --plot-marker PLOT_MARKER
                        string indicating line contains data to plot. Defaults
                        to ">>"
  -R ROW_SEP, --row-sep ROW_SEP
                        delimits data for different subplots. Defaults to ";"
  -C COL_SEP, --col-sep COL_SEP
                        delimits data for the same subplot. Defaults to " "
  -l LABELS, --labels LABELS
                        string of labels. " " delimits labels for the same
                        subplot. ";" delimits lists of subplot labels example:
                        "a1 a2; b1 b2 b3"
  -c COLORS, --colors COLORS
                        string of colors using the same format as labels. Can
                        be any valid matplotlib color
```

Demo
====
The streamplot repository also includes a simple script for generating random data for demo purposes. To run the demo 
```
$ python randomfeeder.py | streamplot
```

Here's an example of the output ![demo](https://raw.github.com/thomlake/streamplot/master/demo.gif)


Uncomment different `numlines` definitions in `randomfeeder.py` to produce different example plots.


TODO
====
 - [x] Add legend functionality
 - [x] Add support for color specification
 - Add support for creating animations
 - There is already a `streamplot` command in matplotlib, maybe a renaming is needed


About
-----
streamplot is just a proof of concept. It works for my own purposes but YMMV. It would be easy to inherit from the `StreamPlotter` class and add needed functionality.
