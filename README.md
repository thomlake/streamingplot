streamplot
==========
Matplotlib based real time plotting
    
    $ somedatageneratingprocess | streamplot

Installation
============
There isn't any. You may want to move the streamplot.py file to somewhere on your `$PATH`, remove the `.py` extension and make it executable. For example:

    $ cp /path/to/streamplot.py ~/bin/streamplot
    $ chmod +x ~/bin/streamplot

Documentation
=============
The `streamplot.py` file constains a class and driver for reading and plotting a stream of incoming data in real time. Any line beginning with `'>>'` is input to be plotted. Everything else will print to stdout.

The stream can contain data for multiple plots (separated by `';'`) and multiple lines per plot (separated by spaces `' '`).

Sometimes an example is worth a thousand words. If we wanted to have 3 separate plots having 3, 2, and 4 lines respectively, the input stream should look something like:

    >> 1 2 3; 4 5; 6 7 8 9;
    >> 0.5 1.5 2.5; 3.5 4.5; 5.5 6.5 7.5 8.5;
    some status message
    >> 0 1 2; 3 4; 5 6 7 8; 
    another status message



About
-----
streamplot is just a proof of concept. It works for my own purposes but YMMV. It would be easy to inherit from the `StreamPlotter` class and add needed functionality.
